Abstract: The derived category of coherent systems is an interesting triangulated category associated with a smooth, projective curve $C$. These categories admit Bridgeland stability conditions, as recently shown by Feyzbakhsh and Novik. Their construction depends explicitly on the higher rank Brill-Noether theory of $C$.
  In this short note, we study the Feyzbakhsh--Novik stability conditions for a general curve of genus four. We show that these stability conditions degenerate to a stability condition on the Kuznetsov component of the corresponding nodal cubic threefold, using a result of Alexeev-Kuznetsov.

Abstract: The canonical projections of the unit spheres are generalized to special generic maps and round fold maps, for example. They are generalizations from the viewpoint of singularity theory of differentiable maps and these maps restrict the topologies and the differentiable structures of the manifolds.
  We are concerned with round fold maps, defined as smooth maps locally represented as the product map of a Morse function and the identity map on a smooth manifold, and maps with singular value sets being concentric spheres. A bit different from differential topology, we are concerned with real algebraic geometric aspects of these maps. We discuss real algebraic realization of round fold maps of codimension $-1$ as our new work. Real algebraic realization of these maps is of fundamental and important studies in real algebraic geometry and a new study recently developing mainly due to the author.
