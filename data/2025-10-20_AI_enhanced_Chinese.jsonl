The key difficulties stem\nfrom two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of\nregistration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which\nhinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation\nover long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an\nefficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is\ndesigned to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging\ntemporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The\nkey to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a\ntwo-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for\nrobust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a\nsliding-window fashion.

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches\nwith potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of\nspatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary\nVLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)\nto impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)\nformulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to\nexplore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically\nextracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them\nas first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel\nlearns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., \"cat\") and a spatial pseudo\ncategory (e.g., \"right of person\") simultaneously, enforcing relational\nconstraints (e.g., a \"cat\" pixel must lie to the right of a \"person\"). Finally,\nthese logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy\nlogic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally\nconsistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows\nclear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of\nonly introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,\nvalidating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The traditional\ngraphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,\nmaterial and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by\nthe multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and\nparameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based\nrelighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view\nOne-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new\ndiverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a\nhigh-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We\nleverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides\na rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The\ninput portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through\nan encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance\nnetwork trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT\nimages to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in\nthe latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively\nsmall number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the\ngenerated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically\naccurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,\nparticularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as\nspecularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.
