Since computing the probability of a sequence given the\ntokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we\ninvestigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no\ngeneration from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling\nstrategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.\n  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling\nstrategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently\naccurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and\ndemonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks."}

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity).

This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus.

While MBR has proven effective in machine\ntranslation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is\nnaturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as\ndialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,\napplying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in\nselecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's\ndistribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of\ngenerations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we\nintroduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to\nmake MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test\nour hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of\nlatent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a\nsentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate\nthe structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common\nsimilarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,\nour proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality.

To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries).

In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms.

By representing both\ninput camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,\nCupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that\nproduces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;\nand (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to\nenhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3\ndB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching\nmonocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity\nover baseline 3D generative models.

Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a\nsupplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth\ninformation of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions\nradar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to\nenable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and\ncamera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a\nradar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration\nto simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)\nthe utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately\nderive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of\nfeature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations\nof mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best\nof our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of\nradar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving\nMOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline\nthe radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced\nby real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual\ntraffic scenarios.

Prior works integrating image\nsegmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ\neither boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These\nmethods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into\ntask-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture\nfine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nsegmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally\nproduces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual\ntokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the\nsegmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To\nreduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to\ngenerate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple\nsegmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while\nmaintaining strong understanding capabilities."}

In the draft stage, small VLMs act as\ndraft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization\ncandidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to\nproduce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering\ncorrect answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a\nconsensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement\nreasoning paths to the verdict.

We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided\nself-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of\ndirect regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember\nsignatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer\nperceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed\nby linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the\nMSI sensor's spectral response function.

Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space.
