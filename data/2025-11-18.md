Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

Abstract: We study the Quot scheme of points $\mathrm{Quot}_d(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^{n}}^{\oplus r})$. We exhibit and compute the cohomology of explicit loci in $\mathrm{Quot}_d(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^{n}}^{\oplus r})$, whose complement has codimension diverging to infinity as $n\rightarrow \infty$. In the case $1<r<\frac{d+1}{2}$ this loci is an irreducible component. The main ingredient in our proof are classification results on maximal-dimensional spaces of commutative matrices satisfying certain generating conditions. Our primary motivation is the study of the ind-scheme \[ \mathrm{Quot}_d(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^{\infty}}^{\oplus r}) := \underset{n\rightarrow \infty}{colim} \mathrm{Quot}_d(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^{n}}^{\oplus r}). \] Finally, we compute the cohomology (with integral coefficients) of the Quot scheme $\mathrm{Quot}_2(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^n}^{\oplus r})$, confirming, in the case $d=2$, a conjecture of Pandharipande.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We describe how to glue prime-to-$p$ torsion sheaves along Harder-Narasimhan strata of Fargues-Scholze's $\mathrm{Bun}_G$ in terms of the cohomology of locally closed strata inside the smooth charts $\mathcal{M}_b \to \mathrm{Bun}_G$ constructed in [FS21], which are moduli of certain split parabolic bundles. Our computations for $G=\operatorname{GL}_2$ explicitly describe images of geometric constant term functors when restricted to a distinguished point inside $\mathrm{Bun}_{T_{\{b\}}}$, where $T_{\{b\}}$ is the split inner form of the Levi quotient of the corresponding parabolic subgroup $P_b$.
